How React parent elements communicate to child elemnet is 

        => through setting and changing the props of child elements
        => props a element can not be changed at the component
        => State is more own to the element and it can this.setState() by the Component

        => even the props or state changes 
            => the render method is re evaluated to calculate the elemnet by ReactDOM
            => then delta is push to the real DOM

        => Usually sate of one state becomes the props of its child components
            => So if the props of the child component to  be changed    
                => only way is child calls a callback passed by the parent to child component
                    => then the call back changes the state of self(parent) and then
                    ReactDOM passed changed data to respsctive child components and they get recalculated

    => So changing data by a child component (which should be reflected in other components) 
        is not straight forwared
    (Ex : add an item to shopping cart and the total count of items shown on the header should be changed)

    ==> This is where Redux comes to the picture (Singal global state)
